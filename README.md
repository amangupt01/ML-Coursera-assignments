# ML Coursera Assignments
These are my solutions of all the programming exercises on the course of [Machine learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)

In the exercises various machine learning algorithms are implimented to solve various real life problems. Details about each excercise is listed below :  

* Ex1: Linear regression in one variable using Gradient Descent algorithm  

* Ex2: Regularised Logistic Regression using fminunc optimisation algorithm 

* Ex3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks : Implemented one-vs-all logistic regression and neural network to recognize hand-written digits.

* Ex4: Neural Networks Learning : Implemented the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition

* Ex5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs. Variance : Implemented regularized linear regression and used it to study models with different bias-variance properties

* Ex6: Support Vector Machines : Implemented SVM to build Spam Classifier 

* Ex7: K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis : Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm and applied it to compress an image. Also implemented principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

* Ex8: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems : Implemented anomaly detection algorithm and applied it to detect failing servers on a network.Also implemented collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.


###### Note :  First five exercises are done in octave while the rest are done in Matlab
